# cSupB
VARI-cSupB is an application of the VARI-merge. It overcomes the complexity of graphs and organize a set of species- or population-specific haplotype sequences of interest. Based on this model, a tri-tuple coordinate system that combines an offset value, topological structure and sample information. Additionally, VARI-cSupB provides a novel method that utilizes complete topological information and efficiently detects variants for highly similar samples, which can be validated by simulated datasets. Moreover, VARI-cSupB can adapt to a complex cycle structure.
